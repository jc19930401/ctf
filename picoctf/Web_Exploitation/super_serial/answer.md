http://mercury.picoctf.net:3449/index.php

First, use dirb to see is any sub page under mercury.picoctf.net:3449
We can found two site by dirb default library:
robots.txt & index.php



The robots.txt give a hints, maybe there are some subpage that extension is .phps, so we use dirb -X .phps to scan again.
